Game-Browser
============

Game Browser comes from the simple idea that making a game should be just as easy as making a web page. Web development has a fairly streamlined approach: 
* Create the markup
* Make it pretty through styling
* Script it to support the user interactions

What if we apply this same pattern to a game making? This makes especially for an interesting pattern when we also apply the MVC pattern for the server delivering the content. In essence, this is an attempt to convert Web application development to Game development.
